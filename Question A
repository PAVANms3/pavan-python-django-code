Question A
On a train, S, R, and J are the fireman, brakeman, and the engineer, but may NOT be in order. Also aboard the train are three businessmen who have the same names: a Mr. S, a Mr. R, and a Mr. J. Using the clues below, can you determine the identity of the Engineer?
Mr. R lives in Dehradun.
The brakeman lives exactly halfway between Noida and Dehradun.
Mr. J earns exactly Rs. 4,00,000 per year.
The brakeman's nearest neighbor, one of the passengers, earns exactly three times as much as the brakeman.
S beats the fireman in badminton.
The passenger whose name is the same as the brakeman's lives in Noida.


1. Mr. R lives in Dehradun and the brakeman's nearest neighbor earns exactly 3 times as much as the brakeman. Therefore, neither Mr. R nor Mr. J are the brakeman's nearest neighbor, so it must be Mr. Smith.

2. S beats the fireman at billiards and the passenger whose name is the same as the brakeman's lives in noida. Mr. R lives in Detroit and Mr. S lives between noida. Therefore, it must be Mr. Jones who lives in Chicago and Jones is the brakeman.

3. S is not the brakeman and he is not the fireman. He must be the engineer.
