Step 1: Required Components
  ESP8266 Module x 1
  Arduino Uno Board x 1
  3.3V Linear Voltage Regulator (LD1117) x 1
  Breadboard x 1
  Jumper Wires

Step 2: Circuit Time
  Make a circuit as per the given diagram after uploading the program.
  Connect the RX pin of ESP8266 to the TX pin of Arduino and TX pin of ESP8266 to the RX pin of Arduino. 
  Also, common both Grounds of ESP8266 and Arduino as per diagram.
  
Step 3: Code Time
  These are two codes for ESP8266 and Arduino board.
  Code for Sender ESP8266
  This is code for Sender ESP8266. First included the SoftwareSerial Library and started SoftwareSerial at RX and TX pin. 
  (pin no 3 and 1) In Setup, SoftwareSerial is started at 9600 Baud. In the loop, written ‘123’ to the Serial.
  
  #include<SoftwareSerial.h> //Included SoftwareSerial Library
//Started SoftwareSerial at RX and TX pin of ESP8266/NodeMCU
SoftwareSerial s(3,1);

void setup() {
  //Serial S Begin at 9600 Baud
  s.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  //Write '123' to Serial
  s.write(123);
  delay(1000);
}

Code for Receiver Arduino
This is code for Receiver Arduino. First declared a variable to store received data. In Setup, Serial Begin at 9600 Baud.
In the loop, read the serial data and store it in a variable.

int data; //Initialized variable to store recieved data

void setup() {
  //Serial Begin at 9600 Baud 
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  data = Serial.read(); //Read the serial data and store it
  delay(1000);
}
Step 4: Upload the code
  Upload the code to ESP8266 and Arduino Board. Make a circuit as per the given diagram after uploading code. 
  ‘123’ will be transmitted from Sender ESP8266 to Receiver Arduino. You can transmit your data or variable like this.
